# ElGamal Encryption and Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Implementation of [ElGamal encryption] and related zero-knowledge proofs
with pluggable crypto backend.

The following protocols are included:

- Additively homomorphic ElGamal encryption
- Zero-knowledge proofs of zero encryption and Boolean value encryption
- Additively homomorphic 1-of-n choice encryption and the corresponding
  zero-knowledge proof of correctness
- Threshold ElGamal encryption via [Shamir's secret sharing][sss],
  including distributed key generation and verifiable distributed decryption.

## ⚠ Warnings

While the logic in this crate relies on standard cryptographic assumptions
(complexity of [decisional Diffie–Hellman][DDH], [computational Diffie–Hellman][CDH]
and [discrete log][DLP] problems in certain groups),
it has not been independently verified for correctness or absence of side-channel attack
vectors. **Use at your own risk.**

ElGamal encryption is not a good choice for general-purpose public-key encryption
since it is vulnerable to [chosen-ciphertext attacks][CCA]. For security,
decryption operations should be limited on the application level.

## Usage

Add this to your `Crate.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
elastic-elgamal = "0.1.0" 
```

See the crate docs for the examples of usage.

## Naming

"Elastic" refers to pluggable backends, encryption with a key shared
among a variable number of participants, and the construction of zero-knowledge ring proofs
(a proof consists of a variable number of rings, each of which consists of a variable number
of admissible values).
`elastic_elgamal` is also one of [autogenerated Docker container names][docker-rng].
